# casio
Arduino Code to simulate Casio calulator watch. I wrote this 2022, while off from work.

## Status
1. The Home screen works and keeps good time
2. The Stop Watch screen fully works and keeps good time
3. Dual time works
4. Calculator screen partially works.
5. All of the fonts and pixel stuff have been fully mapped out
6. Other screen will render for their initial paint, but won't function
7. None of the "set" modes work
8. Even the light works! (The display dimness is changed)
